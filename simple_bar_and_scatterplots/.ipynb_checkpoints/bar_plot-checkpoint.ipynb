    "First we have to get our data into python. What we'll need is two 'lists' in python terminology (or arrays in general programming terminology), one for the x-axis values, and other for the y-axis values. Optionally, I'll be importing a third list with uncertainties for each point. Each of these lists will need to be the same length, but gaps in the series are fine. i.e. if you are missing data at x=20, rather than adding 20 to the list of x values, and adding a 0 to the equivalent spot in the y list, just leave it off both lists.\n",

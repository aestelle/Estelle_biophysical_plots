# Estelle_biophysical_plots
Public scripts for plotting data in python with matplotlib

## What is this?
This is a public repository of example notebooks I've prepared for members of the Elisar Barbar lab. In general, this repository is designed as a resource for analyzing and plotting data in python, and also as a small tutorial for the use of python for visualizing biophysical data. I am designing tutorial notebooks with a range of levels of coding experience in mind, so hopefully even those with minimal experience with coding in general or python specifically will be able to use these tools to generate functional and beautiful plots. Beauty is subjective, and functionality dependent on the data being plotted, so my goal will be to offer suggestions on how to customize your work as desired. 

## What do I need to use this?
In general these notebooks rely on the following software and libraries:
- Python 3.4+
- Jupyter Notebook or Lab
- Matplotlib and Pyplot
- Scipy, particularly scipy.optimize for fitting data to mathematical models

I will attempt to add resources for installing these and setting up python environments as I add to this repository


## Who am I?
My name is Aidan Estelle, at the time of writing I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Elisar Barbar lab at Oregon State University. My work combines computational and experimental biophysics with a focus on NMR spectroscopy, protein-protein interactions, and Bayesian statistical analysis.
